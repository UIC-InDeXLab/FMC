Context

In Hiring By Machine, a fictional case study from the Princeton Dialogues on AI and Ethics, developers at the company Strategeion create a machine learning system called PARiS to automatically rank job applicants based on the content of their resumes.

This dataset can be used alongside the case study or as a toy dataset for exploring fairness in machine learning.
Content

The data is split into two files:

    resumes_development.csv: 619 records used for training and validation.
    resumes_pilot.csv: 1986 records used for the pilot phase.

Each record has 222 binary features:

    218 skill features: whether or not the corresponding skill is on the applicant's resume
    4 protected features: demographic information about the applicant

The columns are labeled and the list of skills can be found in skills.txt. The skills were selected from popular skills in the LinkedIn directory.

The four protected features are:

    Veteran: 1 if the applicant is a veteran, 0 otherwise
    Female: 1 if the applicant is female, 0 otherwise
    URM: 1 if the applicant is an underrepresented minority, 0 otherwise
    Disability: 1 if the applicant has a disability, 0 otherwise

When using this dataset with the case study, the custom scikit-learn classifier PARiSClassifier may be used to represent the model created by the Strategeion developers. The classifier is defined in fairness.py and PARiS.pickle contains the weights for the classifier. The fictional applicant from the case study, Hara, is represented as index 1720 in the pilot dataset.
